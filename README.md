## Scripts

Contains various scripts and programs I have used to automate tasks or make my life easier in some way.

### Types:

1. CLI (Command Line Interface) - Scripts that are run from the command line.
2. GUI (Graphical User Interface) - Scripts that are run from a graphical interface (But are sometimes launched from the command line).
3. Web - Scripts that are run on a web browser.
